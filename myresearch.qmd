Welcome to my research page, where I explore education, data analytics, and discipline-specific learning. My work spans diverse areas, including Learning Analytics, physics education, Higher Education, linguistics, multimodality, and LEGO-based learning, among others. Feel free to explore my reflections, projects, and publications! üòÅ
